GAME ENGINES WITH SOURCE: Learning from the best
-----------------------------------

As a game developer, I find myself often wondering how other people do things and what solutions they have developed to the same problem I'm facing. Aside from the big boys like UE4 and CryEngine, I have noticed that lately a lot of people are working on their own engines and are putting their code on GitHub, and I've found myself downloading some repository, compiling, giving it a quick spin, etc and just tinkering and marveling at the passion they've been putting into their projects. This here is therefore a list as complete as I can make of publicly-available game engine projects/frameworks.
