# GAME ENGINES WITH SOURCE: Learning from the best
-----------------------------------

As a game developer, I find myself often wondering how other people do things and what solutions they have developed to the same problem I'm facing. Aside from the big boys I have noticed that lately a lot of people are working on their own engines and are putting their code on GitHub, and I've found myself downloading repositories, compiling, giving the engine a quick spin, etc and just tinkering and marveling at the passion they've been putting into their projects. This here is therefore a non-exhaustive list of publicly-available game engine projects. Bear in mind that when I say game engine I am referring to a piece of tech that generally has an editor (however complex), a scene description of some sort, input/output, etc.

## Team Engines
Engines that are being developed by teams of individuals, generally are well established and have commercial products behind them.

## Solo Engines
Engines that are being developed generally by a single individual or at most a handful, as either experimental or toy pieces of tech.

## Rendering Engines
These are only the graphics part of an engine but mature enough and well developed that their code is worthwhile to learn from.
